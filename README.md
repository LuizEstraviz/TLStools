# TLStools

A set of command line tools, developed in C++, to aid in Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) efficient data processing, mainly focused on Forestry applications.

## Tools

* `TLSsample`

a fast tool for point cloud sampling, either randomly or systematically (voxel-wise).

* `TLStrees`

a tool for tree detection and stem segmentation based on point cloud pattern recognition techniques.

Each project has its own `README` file, summarizing the algorithms' work and how to use them. Just browse the directories and check it out!

##Binaries

The released (windows) executables are found in the `bin` folder. The source code for every tool is open and available at the respective folders. The projects were compiled with the GNU-GCC compiler under CodeBlocks. The windows executables can be downloaded straight from the `bin` folder. The projects can also be compiled on linux based OS's (tested on Ubuntu Xenial).
